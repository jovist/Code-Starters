David Harbour and Lily Allen are married!

The “Smile” singer, 35, and Stranger Things actor, 45, tied the knot in Las Vegas on Monday, Sept. 7, PEOPLE has confirmed through court records.

The wedding came one day after the couple obtained a marriage license.

While Allen and Harbour never publicly confirmed an engagement, the singer showcased what appeared to be an engagement ring in an Instagram post in May.

She seemed to address her sparkler in the comments section, replying, “First rule of engagement club ………” after a fan asked her about the diamond.

She was first photographed wearing the ring in November.
