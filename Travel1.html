		<h2>Why to visit Santorini</h2>

			Santorini wine is award-winning and it's well worth making visit to a vineyard to do some wine tasting. ... Its low level of rainfall, together with the volcanic landscape and soil mean that Santorini is a unique environment for home-grown food and wine, and that is reflected in what you will see and eat.
			It sounds a like a big brag but Santorini is argued to have one of the best sunset views in the entire world - the sun just seems to drop into the sea in a haze of gold and amber. Oia is known as the best place to view the sunset and people flock there early every evening just to experience it. People turn up by the coach load, and restaurants and bars have priced their meals and drinks accordingly. If you want to avoid the crowds, the views from Firostefani, just down the road, are almost as spectacular, and you can appreciate the view without having to fight for a space.
