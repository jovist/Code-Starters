		RISCO, Texas -- Conditionally reinstated last week, defensive end Randy Gregory signed a one-year extension through 2021 with the Dallas Cowboys on Tuesday that includes a $200,000 signing bonus, according to multiple sources. Gregory and the Cowboys agreed to a similar extension last season, but the NFL disapproved it because suspended players cannot sign new contracts. Gregory reported to The Star for the first time on Monday for COVID-19 testing. He will be able to participate in workouts and meetings, but not practice until Oct. 5. He is eligible to return to game action on Oct. 25 at Washington. Because he is on the commissioner's exempt list, he is being paid.

			As Novak Djokovic steeled himself again to face Roger Federer and the crowd, Djokovic tried to imagine all the scenarios that could come to pass on Centre Court.

But men’s singles finals at Wimbledon have a way of surpassing everyone’s expectations.

Add Sunday’s tightly wound classic to the list as Djokovic defeated Federer, 7-6 (5), 1-6, 7-6 (4), 4-6, 13-12 (3).

“Thank you very much for staying all the way to the end,” Djokovic, the No. 1 seed and defending champion, said to Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge as he clutched the trophy with his 4-year-old son, Stefan, by his side.

It was Djokovic’s fifth Wimbledon singles title, and he secured it by saving two match points on the 37-year-old Federer’s serve and then prevailing in the fifth-set tiebreaker at 12-12, the first of its kind in a Wimbledon final.
